HRCM choosen k-mer lentgh = 14 manually


Step 1. Reference Sequence Extraction (Follow HRCM but include n/N character positions)
Step 2. Target Sequence Extraction (Follow HRCM)
Step 3. Randomly choose n k-mer of length k from reference sequence (Random approach)
Step 4. From target sequence count the number of occurance of each k-mer of reference sequence
Step 5. Calculate (target_file_original_length - k-mer_size*total_number_of_occurance)
Step 6. Select k-mer having minimum value in Step 5
